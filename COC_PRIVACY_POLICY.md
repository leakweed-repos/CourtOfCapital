# Court of Capital - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 20, 2026
Last Updated: February 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Court of Capital ("Game", "we", "us") collects, uses, stores, and shares information when you use the Game on Reddit through Devvit Web.

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to data processed through Game features, including splash/lobby views, matchmaking, PvP invites, active matches, tutorials, sandbox, and weekly leaderboard systems.

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1 Reddit Context Data

We may process identifiers and context provided by Reddit/Devvit at runtime, including:
- Reddit user ID and username;
- subreddit and post context identifiers;
- app and installation context metadata required to run the Game.

### 2.2 Gameplay Data

We may process gameplay state and progression data, including:
- match state, turns, actions, outcomes, and logs;
- invite and lobby status;
- selected faction/deck profile;
- tutorial progress and sandbox usage;
- leaderboard scores and weekly ranking metrics;
- anti-abuse and fair-play enforcement records.

### 2.3 Technical and Operational Data

We may process service diagnostics such as error events, validation failures, and limited operational logs needed for stability, security, and debugging.

## 3. How We Use Data

We use data to:
- run core game features;
- process matchmaking, turns, combat, and resolution logic;
- maintain invites, lobbies, and resume match flows;
- generate and maintain leaderboard and weekly rollover outputs;
- prevent abuse, cheating, spam, and service misuse;
- troubleshoot errors and improve reliability and UX.

## 4. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)

Depending on jurisdiction, processing may rely on:
- performance of a service you request (gameplay operations);
- legitimate interests (security, anti-abuse, service improvement);
- compliance with legal obligations.

## 5. Storage and Retention

Game state is stored using backend infrastructure available to the app (including Devvit Redis namespaces tied to subreddit installation context).

We retain data only as long as reasonably necessary for:
- active gameplay and resume flows;
- leaderboard integrity and weekly lifecycle;
- security and audit needs;
- legal or compliance requirements.

Data may be deleted, aggregated, or anonymized when no longer needed.

## 6. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell personal data.

We may disclose limited data:
- to Reddit/Devvit platform systems required to operate the app;
- to service providers supporting secure infrastructure operations;
- when required by law, legal process, or protection of rights and safety.

## 7. Public vs Private Data

Some gameplay outcomes (for example leaderboard positions or weekly summaries) may be visible in Reddit post/comment context by design.

Do not share sensitive personal information through game-related interactions.

## 8. Data Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. No system can guarantee absolute security.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Game is not directed to children below the minimum age required by Reddit and applicable law. If you believe a child provided data improperly, contact us for review/removal.

## 10. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of data processing.

To submit a request, contact us at: [ADD SUPPORT EMAIL OR URL].

We may need to verify identity and account context before fulfilling requests.

## 11. International Processing

Because Reddit and related infrastructure may operate globally, data may be processed in countries other than your own, subject to applicable safeguards.

## 12. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as the Game evolves. The updated version becomes effective on the posted date.
