Create one shared default fallback illustration for every Court of Capital card that does not have dedicated art yet, and design it as a production-ready image that is fully readable on mobile, consistent with the game lore, visually premium, faction-neutral, lightweight, and safe for Devvit upload. The final target file path is public/assets/cards/fallback_default.svg, with an optional raster alternative at public/assets/cards/fallback_default.png if needed, and if the raster version is used then DEFAULT_CARD_ART_PATH in src/shared/cards.ts must be updated to that PNG path. The preferred output format is SVG to minimize file size and preserve sharp scaling without artifacts. Use a base canvas of 768x1024 in a 3:4 vertical card ratio, keep a safe text and detail zone of at least 56 pixels from each edge, and place the main compositional focal point at horizontal center and about 42 percent of total height. Build a neutral artistic direction that avoids any specific faction identity, starting with a deep tonal gradient background from top #091937 through mid #132c57 to bottom #081021, then add subtle diagonal market-grid linework at around 20 percent opacity to evoke capital markets without clutter. In the visual core, place a central Court Sigil Orb with a radial-gradient energy sphere, two luminous rings including a thicker outer ring and a thin secondary ring, and a restrained glow treatment; combine symbolic motifs of judicial balance and a market hexagon as an abstract emblem of order versus market chaos; add only light bloom and avoid aggressive flares or blown highlights. In the lower section, add a semi-transparent information panel with roughly 18 pixel corner radius and a soft neon-blue outline, containing the texts Court of Capital as headline, Fallback Illustration as secondary line, and Art not yet commissioned as tertiary line, all highly legible at small sizes and free from decorative noise. Lock the palette to navy deep #081021, midnight blue #091937, court blue #132c57, accent cyan #48e5c2, accent azure #8ab7ff, soft text #d6e4ff, and secondary text #9db9f5. Use a technical sans-serif stack with Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif only, without external webfont dependencies, and apply visual hierarchy equivalent to headline 44px weight 700, secondary 30px weight 500, and body 24px weight 400. Enforce UX readability with at least WCAG AA contrast for all panel text, no micro-texture noise in the center where cards are inspected on small screens, and no elements that look like a rushed broken placeholder. Enforce performance constraints with SVG target size below 150KB or PNG below 220KB, and do not embed fonts, binary blobs, or EXIF metadata. Generate the artwork in a vertical fantasy-fintech style with deep midnight blue courtroom-trading atmosphere, center glowing judicial market sigil orb, concentric cyan and azure rings, subtle diagonal market grid in the background, elegant premium lower UI panel with soft neon border, no characters, no logos, no faction symbols, high mobile readability, clean edges, no noise, no blur overload, polished game-ready placeholder quality, cinematic but restrained lighting, coherent courtroom plus capital-markets lore, and crisp vector-friendly rendering. Negative constraints: no text glitches, no watermarks, no extra logos, no photoreal faces, no clutter, no oversaturated neon, no chaotic particles, no visible grain, and no compression artifacts. Accept only a result that looks strong on mobile and desktop, remains fully faction-neutral, always works as the universal fallback visual when dedicated card art is missing, and does not introduce upload or runtime performance regressions.
