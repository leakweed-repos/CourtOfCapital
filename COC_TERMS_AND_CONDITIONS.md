We may take moderation or enforcement actions for abuse, including feature restrictions, lobby removal, invite cancellation, suspension from matchmaking, or account-level block from Game services.

## 7. PvP, Invites, and Lobbies

The Game may include invite-based lobbies, ready checks, match start confirmation, and lobby auto-cleanup behaviors.

You understand that:
- invites may expire or be canceled;
- lobbies may be closed for inactivity;
- ongoing match state may be unavailable if context or platform limits apply.

## 8. Leaderboards and Weekly Resets

Leaderboard standings, weekly posts, and weekly rollovers are gameplay features and may change due to balancing, anti-abuse actions, data consistency updates, or maintenance.

## 9. Updates and Service Changes

We may modify, rebalance, patch, suspend, or discontinue any feature at any time to preserve game quality, fairness, and platform compliance.

## 10. User Content and Feedback

If you provide feedback, bug reports, ideas, or suggestions, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free right to use and adapt that input for development and operation of the Game.

## 11. Intellectual Property

All Game systems, code, mechanics, text, and non-user assets are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. No ownership rights are transferred to you under these Terms.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction selected by the Game operator, excluding conflict-of-law rules, unless mandatory local law provides otherwise.

## 18. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Game after changes become effective means you accept the revised Terms.
